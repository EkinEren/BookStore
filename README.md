This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

<p>This simple online bookstore project uses Google Books API to fetch e-books data, that are available and for sale. </p>
<p>You can search for books by title, author or any type of keyword and add the books you wish to buy into your shopping cart.</p>
<p>This prototype project is made with react and redux. React-router is used for navbar.</p>

## Motivation

As a developer who've newly grasphed the foundations of react & react-router and learning redux, I wanted to create a project that uses both. 
I've learned a great deal in using redux while working on this project, and it has been a good practice to me. :)
