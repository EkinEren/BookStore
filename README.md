[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/EkinEren/BookStore.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/EkinEren/BookStore)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

<p>This simple online bookstore project uses Google Books API to fetch e-books data, that are available and for sale. </p>
<p>You can search for books by title, author or any type of keyword and add the books you wish to buy into your shopping cart.</p>
<p>This prototype project is made with react and redux. React-router is used for navbar.</p>

## Motivation

As a developer who has newly grasped the foundations of react & react-router and learning redux, I wanted to create a project that uses both. 
I've learned a great deal in using redux while working on this project, and it has been good practice to me. :)

## Built with

<ul>
<li>React - Web framework</li>
<li>Redux - For managing the states of the app</li>
<ul><li>Redux thunk - Middleware for redux</li>
<li>Redux logger - Logging tool for redux</li></ul>
<li>Nodejs - Run-time enviroment</li>
<li>React Router - Used for routing & navbar</li>
<li>Antd and bootstrap - For styling</li>
<li>Google Books API - Data is fetched through this API.</li>
</ul>
