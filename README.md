This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

<p>This simple online bookstore project uses Google Books API to fetch e-books data, that are available and for sale. </p>
<p>You can search for books by title, author or any type of keyword and add the books you wish to buy into your shopping cart.</p>
<p>This prototype project is made with react and redux. React-router is used for navbar.</p>

## Motivation

As a developer who've newly grasphed the foundations of react & react-router and learning redux, I wanted to create a project that uses both. 
I've learned a great deal in using redux while working on this project, and it has been good practice to me. :)

## Built with

<ul>
<li>React - Web framework</li>
<li>Redux - For managing the states of the app</li>
<ul><li>Redux thunk - Middleware for redux</li>
<li>Redux logger - Logging tool for redux</li></ul>
<li>Nodejs - Run-time enviroment</li>
<li>Antd and bootstrap - For styling</li>
<li>Google Books API - Data is fetched through this API.</li>
</ul>

## Features

<ul>
<li>Search for a specific book by title, author or any keyword.</li>
<li>View the details of a book, such as a small summary, year it's published or authors.</li>
<li>Add books you'd like to buy into your shopping cart.</li>
<li>View the items in your cart and manage your purchases, remove an item from the cart, see total cost, checkout(not literally :) ).</li>
</ul>

## Getting Started

<h5>Prerequisites</h5>

<ul>
<li>Node.js</li>

## Todo

Make checkout by popup or alert, do not allow duplicate id books into table, add more stuff to 'details'.In table, render for more than one authors.
