This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

<p>This simple online bookstore project uses Google Books API to fetch e-books data, that are available and for sale. 
You can search for books by title, author or any type of keyword and add the books you wish to buy into your shopping cart.
This prototype project is made with react and redux. React-router is used for navbar.</p>
